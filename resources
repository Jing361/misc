List of valuable resources:

Online compilers:
  Coliru can be embedded to other sites
    http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/
  Onlinegdb allows for debugging
    https://www.onlinegdb.com/
  godbolt/compiler explorer has some interesting flags available such as -Wlifetime and is open source
    https://godbolt.org/
  Sort-of an online compiler; builds and presents errors, along with an 'expanded' view of code, making any short hand things explicit.
  e.g. for( auto line : file ) becomes expanded to show the underlying mechanics;
  i.e. auto begin = file.begin(); for( ; begin != end; ++begin)
  Useful for demonstrating things the compiler is assuming that are not obvious

  wandbox has support for lots of compilers and options; provides a vim plugin;
  and provides some additional diagnostic information (the extent of which I do not yet know)
